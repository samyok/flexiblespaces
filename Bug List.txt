paths of length one have undefined behaviour when a block they started or ended at is dragged. this is due to path_starts being based on current_path_start_room, which is assigned on line 334

features to add:
 - corner replacemetn for when pathing ends next to a block but the last path isn't facing it
 - Tokens
 - Illusion of choice / forced path
 - signs
